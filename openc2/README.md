The OpenC2 Language Specification defines a language used to compose messages that instruct
and coordinate the command and control of cyber defenses between and within networks and systems.

This crate provides types for OpenC2 commands and responses.

# Crate Purpose
This crate helps actuator implementers and other cybersecurity vendors interact with OpenC2 messages.

# Status
This crate is under active development. As the OpenC2 spec matures, the API for this library will similarly evolve.
